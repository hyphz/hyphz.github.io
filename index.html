  <h1>Strike! Character Generator</h1>
  <p>This is a web technology-based character generator for the Strike! RPG.</p>
  <p>You can <a href="StrikeGen.html">use it online</a> (everything is on the client - nothing
    is sent to the server), or <a href="StrikeGen.zip">download it</a> for your own use; just
    unzip the file in any folder then open <i>StrikeGen.html</i> with your web browser
    (assuming it's a decent modern browser, that is).</p>
    <p>If you feel inclined, you can get the source code or help with the development on
      <a href="http://github.com/hyphz/Strikegen">GitHub</a>.</p>
