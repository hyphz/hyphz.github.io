  <h1>Strike! Character Generator</h1>
  <p>This is a web technology-based character generator for the Strike! RPG.</p>
  <p>You can <a href="StrikeGen.html">use it online</a> (everything is on the client - nothing
    is sent to the server), or <a href="StrikeGen.zip">download it</a> for your own use; just
    unzip the file in any folder then open <i>StrikeGen.html</i> with your web browser
    (assuming it's a decent modern browser, that is).</p>
    <p>If you feel inclined, you can get the source code or help with the development on
      <a href="http://github.com/hyphz/Strikegen">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>If you've never heard of the Strike! RPG, you should probably visit the
      <a href="http://www.strikerpg.com">Strike! Home Page</a> and learn about it, because it's
      fantastic. Or you could just go right ahead and
      <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/158239/Strike?affiliate_id=89109">buy it</a>
      to download right now.</p>
